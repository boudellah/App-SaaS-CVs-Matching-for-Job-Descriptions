# App-SaaS-CVs-Matching-for-Job-Descriptions
## A. Problem Statement:
Traditional CV screening processes present several challenges that hinder efficient and effective recruitment. Recruiters often face an overwhelming number of applications, making it difficult to thoroughly evaluate each candidate.

This high volume can lead to inconsistent evaluation criteria, where different recruiters may apply varying standards, resulting in qualified candidates being overlooked. Also the manual nature of traditional screening is time consuming and labor intensive, diverting valuable resources from other critical HR functions.

## B. Solution Overview:
To address these challenges, we have developed an AI powered application that automates the CV screening process. Our app leverages advanced technologies to analyze and match job descriptions with candidate profiles, ensuring a more efficient and accurate selection process, by integrating RAG, multimodal data processing, LangChain for orchestration and LLM, so our solution provides a comprehensive approach to candidate matching.
